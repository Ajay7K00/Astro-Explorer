            <p>
                We are a research group at a state university, where financial support for research is limited. Over the past three years, more than 12 students have contributed to our work, driven by their passion for scientific discovery. Many of them wished to continue, but due to funding constraints, they had to discontinue their work. Despite working in our labs for a year or more with little to no financial support, their dedication led them to secure positions at prestigious global and national institutes.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, this lack of funding is a challenge we must address. To ensure that talented students can pursue cutting-edge research without financial hardship, we seek support from the community and corporate partners who share our vision.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition to research, we offer consultancy services for industries affected by space weather and commercial startups in this field. Your support can make a significant impact by sustaining our research and helping the next generation of scientists thrive.
